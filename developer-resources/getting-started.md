# Getting started

## What is a dApp?

In the Web2 world, application code is deployed and run on centralized servers, most likely hosted in a data center and run by a cloud services provider. In Web3 application code is run on a blockchain which is a peer-to-peer network of computers.

## Create a dApp

You can use the [**dappKit**](sdks-and-providers/dapp-kit/) to create your first dApp.&#x20;

## Submit your dApp

After you create the dApp, you can submit it in the [Vechain App Hub Repo](https://github.com/vechain/app-hub#vechain-app-hub---submit-form) to let it be visible in the [Vechain App Hub](https://apps.vechain.org/#all)
